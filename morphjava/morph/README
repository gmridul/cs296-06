1. Make sure ImageMagick libraries are installed. In particular libMAgick++ and Magick++.h. Adjust the paths in the makefile to these files.

2. Run make

3. In this implementation the names of the source and target images are hadcoded, as are their widths and heights. You should not do this in the assignment.

4. Pairs of left clicks create lines on the source, pairs of right clicks create lines on the target.

5. Press m to start the morph. This will create 11 images named test_00.jpg to test_10.jpg.
