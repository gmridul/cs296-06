\section{Introduction}
This report is written to explain the physics of \lq\lq The Pendulum\rq\rq{}, \lq\lq The Pulley System\rq\rq{}, \lq\lq The See--Saw System\rq\rq{} which are coded in the constructor of dominos.cpp file.

\section{Physics behind the simulation}
\subsection{Pendulum}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{pendulum}
\end{center}
Let the bob of the pendulum\cite{pendulum} be released at an initial angle $\theta_o$  from vertical. Then the speed of the bob, $v$ at an angle $\theta$  will be given by the formula :
\begin{equation}
                                                  v = \sqrt{\frac{2gl}{m}(\cos\theta - \cos\theta_o)}
\end{equation}
where $v$ is in \emph{meters/second}, $g$ is acceleration due to gravity in \emph{meters/second$^2$}, $l$ is the length of the string of pendulum in \emph{meters}, $m$ is the mass of bob in \emph{kilograms}, $\theta$ and $\theta_o$ are in \emph{radian}.

\subsection{Pulley System}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{pulley}
\end{center}
This pulley\cite{pulley} system contains weights on both sides. Let the masses be $m_1$ and $m_2$. Then the acceleration $a$ of the weights will be :
\begin{equation}
                                                   a = \frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2}g \mbox{ (assuming $m_1 \geq m_2$)}
\end{equation}
where $a$ is in \emph{meters/second$^2$}, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are in \emph{kilograms} and $g$ is acceleration due to gravity in \emph{meters/second$^2$}.\\*\\*
When the weights have travelled a distance of height $h$, then the speed of the weights, $v$ will be given by the following equation :
\begin{equation}
                                                 v = \sqrt{\frac{2a}{h}} \mbox{ (where $a$ is as used in (2))}
\end{equation}
where $v$ is in \emph{meters/second} and $h$ is in \emph{meters}.

\subsection{See--Saw System}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{seesaw}
\end{center}
When torque\cite{seesaw} is applied to a rod which is hinged at the centre, then the object of mass $m$ kept at some distance $l$ from the hinge experience force. Thus the equation governig this system is as follows :
\begin{equation}
  \vec{\tau} = \frac{ml^2}{12} \times \vec{\alpha}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{\tau}$ is a vector whose magnitude is the torque applied and is measured in \emph{Newton.meter}, $m$ is in \emph{kilograms}, $l$ is in \emph{meters}, $\vec{\alpha}$ is the angular acceleration vector of the object and its magnitude is measured in \emph{radian/second$^2$}.
\section{Conclusions}
We mentioned three systems in the report, namely pendulum, pulley and see-saw, and explained their functioning using mathematical equations which they follow.
